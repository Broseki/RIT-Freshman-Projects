# RIT-Freshman-Projects

Here are the project that I completed during my freshman year at RIT for CSAPX.

Keep in mind that my programming ability has improved since I took this class, but
it is still a good repository to see some of my older code style.

All of my code has my name clearly written at the top. For the most part, any code without my name as the author
is property of the RIT CS Department.
